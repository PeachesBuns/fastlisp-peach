this is a comment. here lambda spawns an environment where id equals
(lamdbda x x). id is self applied twice. the result is applied to a
string.)

) (lambda x x) 

(text this is a string containing the (right-parentheses) variable.)

(comment the behavior of \ in text is undefined. text can be sugar for
pairs of booleans in the lambda calculus. if fastlisp halts it returns a
lambda that can guide macro expansion in the outer system extending the
syntax.)
