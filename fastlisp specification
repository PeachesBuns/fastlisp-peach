 this is a comment. here we use lambda as let to spawn an environment
 where an object named id is applied to itself twice, then applied to
 a string.)
 (comment these are my names)
((lambda id 

         (comment this is the pain program)
         (id id id)) 
         
(comment these are my definitions)         
(lambda x x) 
(comment the return value of the latter program is applied to this string)
(text this is a string containing a \). the behavior of \\ is undefined.) text is sugar for pairs of booleans in the lambda calculus. if fastlisp halts it returns a lambda that can guide macro expansion in the outer system extending the syntax.))
